## üé≠ THE REVOLUTION - HOW IT WORKS

**Traditional TTRPG:** "I attack" ‚Üí Roll dice ‚Üí Success/Failure

**MYNFINI Revolution:** "I describe creatively" ‚Üí AI evaluates ‚Üí Creativity DEFEATS statistics

### **5-Tier Creativity System**
1. **BASIC** (+0) - Simple actions
2. **TACTICAL** (+2) - Multi-step planning
3. **CREATIVE** (+4 + extra die) - Environmental innovation
4. **BRILLIANT** (+6 + extra die) - Multi-element mastery
5. **LEGENDARY** (+8 + narrative points) - Reality-bending creativity

### **Revolutionary Mechanics**
- **Personal Classes**: Your behavior creates unique classes
- **Choice-Based XP**: Failure teaches more than success
- **Narrative Points**: Drama becomes power
- **Pressure Systems**: Adversity fuels growth
- **Multi-Axis Progression**: Six simultaneous development paths

## üéÆ SOLO GAMEPLAY FLOW

### **Session Setup**
1. Start server with your API key
2. Create character using class analysis
3. Set initial scene context
4. Begin interactive play

### **The Solo Cycle**
```
1. PLAYER describes creative action

2. SYSTEM evaluates creativity tier

3. MECHANICS apply bonuses/penalties

4. AI generates narrative outcome

5. SYSTEM tracks behavioral patterns

6. PROGRESSION advances multiple axes

7. REPEAT with new dramatic situations
```

### **Example Solo Session**

**Scene**: You face the Bandit Lord in a candlelit hall

**Your Turn**: "I grab the candelabra and swing it while the hot wax splatters across his face"

**System Response**: *"CRATIVITY EVALUATION: CREATIVE tier achieved (+4 mechanical bonus + d6 extra)... [AI generates narrative describing your tactical brilliance]"*

**Player Response**: "I capitalize on his blindness by using the polished floor to slide under his wild swing"

**System Response**: *"BRILLIANT execution! Your creative momentum builds toward a Legendary moment..."*

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### **"API Key Invalid" Error**
- Verify key starts with `sk-ant-`
- Check key copied correctly (no spaces)
- Try regenerating key at console.anthropic.com
**Test**: `echo %ANTHROPIC_API_KEY%` should show your key

### **"Connection Refused" Error**
- Ensure server is running: `tasklist | findstr python`
- Check port 5000 not occupied: `netstat -ano | findstr 5000`
- Verify Windows Firewall allows localhost connections
- Try browser at http://localhost:5000/api/systems/status

### **"Unicode Error" in Commands**
- Use ASCII characters only in descriptions
- Avoid special characters in JSON payloads
- Use escape characters for quotes: `\"`
- Test basic commands first, then add complexity

### **"System Not Found" Error**
- Verify all Python files in directory
- Check imports work: `python -c "import advanced_ai_orchestrator"`
- Ensure revolutionary_systems_implementation.py exists
- Verify working directory is mynfini-web

### **"Creativity Evaluation Failed"**
- Test with simpler descriptions first
- Ensure context contains established elements
- Gradually increase complexity
- Check API rate limits aren't exceeded
