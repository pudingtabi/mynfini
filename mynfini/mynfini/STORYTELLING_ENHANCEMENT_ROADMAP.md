**Purpose**: Create intentional mystery seeding and delayed revelation systems

```python
class CuriosityGapEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_mysteries = {}
        self.revelation_timings = {}
        self.player_investment_levels = {}

    def seed_mystery(self, mystery_id: str, context: Dict, reveal_conditions: List[str]):
        """Plant seeds for future revelations"""
        self.active_mysteries[mystery_id] = {
            'context': context,
            'conditions': reveal_conditions,
            'investment_score': 0.0,
            'seeded_session': session.current_session_id
        }

    def track_investment(self, mystery_id: str, player_actions: List[str]):
        """Monitor player engagement with mystery elements"""
        # Implementation for investment tracking
        pass

    def generate_cliffhanger(self, scene_context: Dict) -> str:
        """Create compelling scene endings with unresolved questions"""
        # Implementation for cliffhanger generation
