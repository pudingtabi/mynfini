DETAILED WINDOWS TESTING PROTOCOL - MYNFINI REVOLUTIONARY SYSTEM

  Below is your comprehensive step-by-step testing checklist. Execute these exact steps, record detailed results, and report back with evidence at each stage.

  PHASE 1: WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT SETUP

  Step 1.1: System Preparation

  Location: Your Windows computer (any version from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 11)

  Commands to execute:
  1. Press Windows Key + R, type cmd, press Enter
  2. In Command Prompt, execute:
  ver
  systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
  echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%

  Record these details:
  - Windows version (exact output)
  - Processor architecture (x86, AMD64, etc.)

  1. Open File Explorer
  2. Navigate to: C:\Users\mrcpe\OneDrive\Documents\Obsidian Vault\TTRPG\mynfini\mynfini-web
  3. Open PowerShell as Administrator: Right-click in folder â†’ "Open PowerShell window here"

  Execute these exact commands:
  Get-Location
  Get-ChildItem -Name
  $env:OneDrive
  Test-Path ".\complete_revolutionary_system.py"

  Record these details:

  PHASE 2: DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION

  Step 2.1: Python Environment Check

  Execute these exact commands:
  python --version
  pip --version

  Record these details:
  - Python version (must be 3.8+)
  - pip version
  - Any error messages if Python not found

  Step 2.2: Install Required Packages

  FLASK_DEBUG=1
  "@ | Out-File -FilePath ".env" -Encoding UTF8

  # Verify file creation
  Get-Content ".env"

  Record these details:
  - .env file content (hide your actual API key)

  4. Generate new API key
  5. Copy the key (36-character string)

  Step 3.2: Configure API Key

  Replace your_key_here with your actual key:
  # Edit .env file with your real key
  (Get-Content ".env") -replace 'your_key_here', 'YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE' | Set-Content ".env"

  # Verify key is set (but don't show actual key)
  Get-Content ".env" | Select-String -NotMatch "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"

  Record these details:
  - API key successfully added to .env file
  - Key format validation (should be 36 characters)
  - Environmental variable set confirmation

  PHASE 4: SYSTEM STARTUP

  PHASE 7: ERROR DOCUMENTATION

  If You Encounter Errors:

  Record these EXACT error messages:
  - Copy/paste complete error text including traceback
  - Note the exact command that caused the error
  - Screenshot error if text is too long
  - Document what you were doing when error occurred

  Specific Error Patterns to Watch For:

  - Network connectivity errors (connection refused, timeouts)
  - Python import errors (ModuleNotFoundError, ImportError)
  - API rate limiting (429 errors, quota exceeded)
  - Authentication errors (401, invalid API key)
  - Flask startup errors (port conflicts, binding issues)
  - Permission errors (running as administrator needed)

  FINAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS

  After completing ALL phases above, send me a comprehensive report including:

  Mandatory Report Items:

  1. Windows Environment Details (from Phase 1.1)
  2. Installation Results (from Phase 2 detailed results)
  3. API Connectivity Results (from Phase 5 detailed responses)
  4. Revolution Verification (from Phase 6 results)
  5. ANY Error Messages (complete text with context)

  Optional But Helpful:

  6. Screenshots of terminal output showing success
  7. Browser screenshots showing web interface working
  8. Video recording of the entire test process (if errors occur)

  Success Criteria:

  - Web application starts without errors
  - API calls return proper JSON responses
  - Creativity evaluation returns TACTICAL tier or higher
  - System indicates "REVOLUTION COMPLETE" status
  - No critical blocking errors during execution

  Remember: The more detailed your evidence, the better I can help resolve any Windows-specific issues!
