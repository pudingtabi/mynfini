## 🔧 TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Priority 1: Concept Refocus [High Impact, Medium Effort]**

**Multiplayer Session Management → Solo World Persistence**
```python
# Current: Multiplayer session-based storage
session['player_1'] = {"name": "Player", "health": 10, "stats": {}}

# Required: Solo world persistence
world_state["creator"] = {"name": "Creator", "world_colors": [], "discoveries": []}
```

**TTRPG Rule Systems → Creative Freedom Tools**
```python
# Current: TTRPG rules with restrictions
if player_data["health"] < 10:
    return game_over_response()

# Required: Creative freedom with bonuses
if creativity_evaluation["tier"] == "CREATIVE":
    return world_expansion_response(bonus_discovery=True)
```

**Turn-Based Mechanics → Creative Flow System**
```python
# Current: Turn-based with waiting
await other_players_ready()
send_player_action(player_action)

# Required: Free-flow creativity
process_creative_action(creator_description)
generate_world_response(environment_context)
```

### **Priority 2: UI/UX Evolution [High Impact, Low Effort]**

**Remove Multiplayer Interface Elements**
- ✓ Remove "Wait for other players" messages
- ✓ Remove multiplayer session management UI
- ✓ Simplify to creator-centric dashboard

**Add World-Building Interface Elements**
- ✓ Add personal workspace customizations
- ✓ Add world continuity monitoring
- ✓ Add creative inspiration generators
